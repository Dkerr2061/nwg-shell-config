<span font-size="x-large">nwg-shell v0.2.5 (2022.09.02)</span>

This release replaces the `autotiling` script (package) with the `nwg-autotiling` command (nwg-shell-config entry point). This is to avoid adding the shell-specific stuff to the original script, which is quite widely used outside the project. All the arguments remain the same. The new script is better tailored to the shell, and should be more stable.

Update process will replace `autotiling` with `nwg-autotiling` in your `autostart` file. This should be 100% safe.
